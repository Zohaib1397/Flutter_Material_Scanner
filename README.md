# Material Scanner

## Introduction

The idea is to implement a document scanner application that can export images/documents to pdf and OCR feature.
Following are some listed features that are needed to be considered.

## Feature set

<ol>
 <li>Image Capture:</li>
 <p>Allow users to capture images of documents using their device's camera.
Provide real-time preview for adjusting document positioning and quality before capturing.</p>
</ol>
Image Processing:
Implement image enhancement techniques to improve the quality of scanned documents (e.g., cropping, rotation, brightness/contrast adjustment).
Use edge detection algorithms to identify and enhance text and document edges.
Optical Character Recognition (OCR):
Integrate OCR technology to convert scanned text into editable and searchable content.
Support multiple languages and fonts for accurate text recognition.
Document Format Conversion:
Convert scanned documents to popular formats like PDF, JPEG, or PNG.
Maintain high-quality formatting during conversion.
Auto-Crop and Deskew:
Automatically detect document boundaries and crop unnecessary background.
Correct skewed documents to ensure they are aligned properly.
Batch Scanning:
Allow users to scan multiple documents in succession and organize them into a single file or separate files.
Cloud Integration:
Provide options to save scanned documents to cloud storage services (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox) for easy access and backup.
Search and Organization:
Implement a search function to locate specific documents based on keywords.
Enable users to organize scanned documents into folders or categories.
Security and Privacy:
Ensure secure data transmission and storage of scanned documents.
Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive information.
User-Friendly Interface:
Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface with easy-to-use controls.
Offer clear instructions and feedback during the scanning process.
Offline Mode:
Allow users to scan documents without requiring an active internet connection.
Sync and upload scanned documents when the device is back online.
Accessibility Features:
Ensure the application is accessible to users with disabilities by following accessibility guidelines.
Device Compatibility:
Optimize the application to work smoothly on a variety of devices, including smartphones and tablets


## Business Perspective

The main perspective of building this application is to have a use-full tool and practice on the coding standards such as clean architecture, and Material 3 deign structure. Later-on, the application will be deployed on App Store and PlayStore with in app-purchases. 

## Design Structure
 The design of the application is inspired completely from Material You released by google development team.

￼
The application will feature a home screen with two possible layout structure i.e. grid layout & linear layout. A camera FAB is used to scan a new or list of images. If the user selects for the Burst of images then a folder will be created automatically.
